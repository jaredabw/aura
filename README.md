# Aura Bot

Aura Bot is a Discord bot that allows a server to have a leaderboard of 'aura', similar to Reddit karma. Moderators must assign a points impact to reactions that are to be tracked. These points will be added to or subtracted from a user's score when they receive this reaction.

## Features
- Track emoji reactions and assign points (positive or negative) to users.
- Display a leaderboard of users based on their scores.
- Manage tracked emojis (add, remove, or update).
- Use default emojis or emojis from each server.
- Opt in or out from participating.
- Configure cooldowns and spam limits.
- Mods can allow or deny users from participating.
- Automatically update leaderboards at regular intervals.
- Easy setup and configuration for each server.
