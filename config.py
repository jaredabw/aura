__**SETUP:**__
1. Run </setup:1356179831288758384>. If you want a live leaderboard, create a new channel and provide it.

4. Watch the leaderboard in the new channel, or run </leaderboard:1356179831288758387> to see it!

__**INFO:**__
- All reactions are counted when multiple people put the same reaction on a message.
- You require Manage Channels permissions to run commands that affect the setup.
- Emoji must be standard emoji or emoji from this server.
- Implements two spam filters: 
  - 10 second cooldown on giving aura (per server user recipient combination); ignored if a user removed their reaction, i.e. put the wrong reaction, removed it, and added the correct reaction.  
  - Temporary bans from giving aura for excessive reaction additions and/or removals in a short period of time.
  - These values are configurable at your discretion.
- If you are getting the error "A specified channel ID is invalid" when trying to use /setup or /updatechannel, try running the command on PC."""
